A newborn king to see`little drummer boy
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots`it’s beginning to look a lot like christmas
All is calm, all is bright`silent night
At the Christmas party hop`rockin around the Christmas tree
Fa la la la la la la la la`deck the halls
I don’t want a doll, no dinkey tinker toys`I want a hippopotamus for christmas
I’ve been an awful good girl`santa baby
In a one horse open sleigh`jingle bells
In the lane, snow is glistening`winter wonderland
It’s the best time of the year`have a holly jolly christmas
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring`jingle bell rock
Let your heart be light`have yourself a merry little christmas
Let’s run and we’ll have some fun`frosty the snowman
Oh what a laugh it would have been`I saw mommy kissing santa claus
Ring-ting-tingling too`sleigh ride
Sister Susie sitting on a thistle`All I want for Christmas are my two front teeth
The lights are turned way down low`let it snow
There is just one thing I need`all I want for xmas is you
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow`chestnuts roasting on an open fire`the christmas song
We can hardly stand the wait`chipmunk song`Christmas don’t be late
Where the treetops glisten`white Christmas
With the kids jingle belling`it’s the most wonderful time of the year
You can say there’s no such thing as Santa`grandma got run over by a reindeer
Your heart is full of unwashed socks, your soul is full of gunk`Grinch
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer`Here comes Santa Claus
